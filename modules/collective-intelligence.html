        <h1>INTRODUCTION TO COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE</h1></br></br>
        <p class="last">In the Collective Intelligence Learning Module, we’re going to look at using new technologies for defining problems collaboratively. Specifically, we’re going to explore how to undertake such collaboration efficiently and effectively and by tapping into people’s expertise both to define the problem and to devise innovative solutions. By the end of this module, we hope you will be able to: 1) understand why and when it is crucial to use collective intelligence to define and to solve problems; 2) describe a range of methods by which collective intelligence is being used in the public sector, including open innovation, collaboration and co-creation; 3) understand and apply key considerations for designing an effective open innovation project; and, 4) anticipate and mitigate common pitfalls when using open innovation to solve a public problem.</p>

          <p class="int-text"> 
            In this interview, Stefaan Verhulst, Chief Research and Development Officer at the Governance Lab at New York University, describes data collaboratives, their impact on understanding and solving public problems, and the key considerations that go into creating a data collaborative. 
            Using an example, he illustrates how data collaboratives were used to investigate the intersection of urban mobility and gender, combining a wide range of datasets, including call detail records and 
            high-resolution satellite data, in order to understand if and how gender plays a role in the way people move around megacities.

          <p>
              Stefaan G. Verhulst is Co-Founder and Chief Research and Development Officer of the Governance Laboratory @NYU (GovLab), where he is responsible for building a research foundation on how to transform governance using advances in science and technology.

              He is the Curator and Editor of the Living Library and The Digest.
              
              Verhulst’s latest scholarship centers on how technology can improve people’s lives and the creation of more effective and collaborative forms of governance. Specifically, he is interested in the perils and promise of collaborative technologies and how to harness the unprecedented volume of information to advance the public good.
              
              Before joining NYU full-time, Verhulst spent more than a decade as Chief of Research for the Markle Foundation, where he continues to serve as Senior Advisor. At Markle, an operational foundation based in New York, he was responsible for overseeing strategic research on all the priority areas of the Foundation, including: transforming health care using information and technology, re-engineering government to respond to new national security threats, improving people’s lives in developing countries by connecting them to information networks, developing multi-stakeholder networks to tackle global governance challenges, and changing education through information technology. Many of Markle’s reports have been translated into legislation and executive orders and have informed the creation of new organizations and businesses.

            <p>This resource is a short introduction into a much more extensive report, both of which address how to develop and deliver effective prizes and rewards. McKinsey’s research has found that prizes are a unique and powerful tool that should be in the basic toolkit of many of today’s philanthropists. Thus, this article briefly defines prizes, and suggests when they work best and the best practices for designing them. Then, the full report draws, “on academic literature, interviews with analysts and practitioners, surveys of prize sponsors and competitors, databases of small and large awards, and case studies of 12 effective prizes to produce lessons from a range of sectors, goals, and prize types.”</p>

                <h3>QUESTION 1</h3>
                <p>Select the best answer:</br></br>

                  The underlying philosophy of open innovation approaches is that they recognize that: 

                    </p>
                <p>
      
                    <label class="options o4"><input type="radio" class="r_button" name="questions" value="wrong" /> Connecting with people from other jurisdictions helps us to benchmark our own performance 
                    </label></br>
                    <label class="options o4"><input type="radio" class="r_button" name="questions" value="correct" /> There are latent resources and capabilities in people outside the sphere of our usual working routines that we can tap to better understand or solve a problem</label></br>
                    <label class="options o4"><input type="radio" class="r_button" name="questions" value="wrong" /> Accessing global expertise is always better than what’s available locally 
                    </label></br>
                    <label class="options o4"><input type="radio" class="r_button" name="questions" value="wrong" /> It is important that both success and failure is shared among a group 
                    </label></br>
                  </p>
      
                <p><button class="submit_button s4" type="button" name="getVal" id="1">Check my answer!</button></p>
      
                </fieldset>
            </form>
      
          <p class="answer-correct hide">
            Correct! Whether they are across the hall or around the globe, domain experts or residents, open innovation helps us tap into the knowledge and experiences of a wider group of people to better understand and solve problems.
            </p>
          <p class="answer-wrong hide">

                  Crowdsourcing is a way of accessing collective intelligence that has been defined as an open call to assist with a task traditionally done by employees alone. A useful form of crowdsourcing for situations when the skills needed to develop a solution are unclear is called  __________ - based approach.

                  What distinguishes collaboration from co-creation as a type of collective intelligence is that the former is more focused on marshalling the efforts of a community with a common vision, whereas the latter is more about generating many diverse responses to a question.

        The tasks that we can ask people to undertake in an open innovation process include:

          <p>

              <label class="options o4"><input type="checkbox" class="messageCheckbox'" name="questions-all-correct" id="5" value="correct" /> sharing ideas</label></br>

<p class="answer-correct hide"> Correct! All of these things can be undertaken by “the crowd.” Which ones we choose depend on what tasks elicit the kind of input we need. So a hackathon might be a good way to get feasible ideas from a smaller, more knowledgeable group in a short space of time, and crowdfunding might suit situations where a bigger audience can be encouraged to make smaller financial contributions that can add up to a large amount.

  <p class="answer-correct hide">That’s right! It sounds simple but there’s nothing worse than setting up an open innovation project and encouraging people to participate only to get a poor turnout because of barriers such as lack of access to technology or jargonistic language that makes it hard for people to understand what is required of them. Requiring people to identify themselves can be important in some processes (e.g. where it is important that someone is a resident) but if we are just seeking good ideas it doesn’t need to be a requirement. </p>

  <p class="answer-correct hide">Correct! The research suggests non-financial incentives work best. These can include appeals to people’s sense of civic responsibility, public recognition, a sense of really making a difference, and the opportunity to build new skills. Finding the incentives that will motivate your audience to contribute is crucial to generating good inputs.

          Ann is designing an open innovation exercise where the public is being asked to submit ideas for how a local park should be upgraded for surrounding neighborhoods. It has been a topic of public discussion for some time, and there are different views within the community about what type of upgrade should be done.  Ann expects various community groups, and possibly thousands of residents, to come forward with many different ideas. For at least a first stage evaluation of the ideas, Ann should strongly consider: </p>
        <p>
            <p>

                <label class="options o4"><input type="radio" class="r_button" name="questions" value="correct" /> Asking members of the public to rate ideas (e.g. “like” them on an online list of the ideas)</label></br>
                <label class="options o4"><input type="radio" class="r_button" name="questions" value="wrong" /> Using expert judges to determine the feasibility of the ideas, screening out those that are unworkable due to technical reasons</label></br>
                <label class="options o4"><input type="radio" class="r_button" name="questions" value="wrong" /> Requiring any idea to have a minimum number of resident supporters before it is even accepted</label></br>
                <label class="options o4"><input type="radio" class="r_button" name="questions" value="wrong" /> Requiring people to provide evidence of park upgrades similar to the one they are proposing, setting out why it’s a good idea in this case</label></br>

  <p class="answer-correct hide"> That’s right! Ann could ask the people in the affected neighbourhoods to “vote” for their favorite ideas as a way to both manage the high volume of ideas and to improve the chances of identifying ideas that will enjoy broad community support. In further stages, Ann could consider using other forms of evaluation, such as asking technical experts to screen out ideas that aren’t feasible. </p>
