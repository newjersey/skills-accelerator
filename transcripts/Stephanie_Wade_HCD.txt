Transcript: What is Human Centered Design? Stephanie Wade100:00:16,119 --> 00:00:21,290welcome in our last module we talked200:00:19,130 --> 00:00:23,270about defining actionable and specific300:00:21,290 --> 00:00:25,550problems and the importance of doing so400:00:23,270 --> 00:00:29,300in consultation with those most affected500:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,400by them today we tackle human centered600:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,219design also sometimes known as design700:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,190thinking a structured set of methods and800:00:34,219 --> 00:00:39,050tools for consulting with citizens the900:00:37,190 --> 00:00:41,269target audience for our policy or1000:00:39,050 --> 00:00:43,819services in order to arrive at1100:00:41,269 --> 00:00:47,690innovative solutions that truly respond1200:00:43,819 --> 00:00:50,059to people's needs take the example of1300:00:47,690 --> 00:00:51,940California's food stamp program while1400:00:50,059 --> 00:00:55,489the state allowed people to apply online1500:00:51,940 --> 00:00:57,920that application was 50 web pages long1600:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,539with over a hundred questions most1700:00:57,920 --> 00:01:02,959families who started the process would1800:00:59,539 --> 00:01:07,130end up abandoning it but by using human1900:01:02,959 --> 00:01:08,840centered design or HCD namely analyzing2000:01:07,130 --> 00:01:11,329the process from the perspective of the2100:01:08,840 --> 00:01:13,969person using it the NGO Code for America2200:01:11,329 --> 00:01:16,340was able to reduce the time it takes to2300:01:13,969 --> 00:01:18,770complete that food stamp application to2400:01:16,340 --> 00:01:22,670less than 10 minutes substantially2500:01:18,770 --> 00:01:24,500increasing enrollment HCD involves2600:01:22,670 --> 00:01:27,649ethnographic and qualitative research2700:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,200techniques like listening observing and2800:01:27,649 --> 00:01:32,119interviewing to connect with people as2900:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,359part of an iterative problem-solving3000:01:32,119 --> 00:01:38,000process ok let's get started on doing it3100:01:35,359 --> 00:01:40,520by the time you finish this module you3200:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,170will we hope number one understand the3300:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,969principles of human centered design and3400:01:42,170 --> 00:01:46,670how they can be used in the public3500:01:43,969 --> 00:01:49,039sector to define your problem number two3600:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,079understand why it is important to place3700:01:49,039 --> 00:01:53,179residents at the center of your work and3800:01:51,079 --> 00:01:55,490number three have an introductory3900:01:53,179 --> 00:01:58,719knowledge of methods for using human4000:01:55,490 --> 00:02:01,640centered design in actual practice as4100:01:58,719 --> 00:02:04,759public officials we're seldom solving4200:02:01,640 --> 00:02:06,979our own problems we cannot always know4300:02:04,759 --> 00:02:09,380for ourselves what it's like to live4400:02:06,979 --> 00:02:12,260with a disease with traffic or4500:02:09,380 --> 00:02:14,960discrimination in a given community yet4600:02:12,260 --> 00:02:17,510we bear responsibility for ameliorating4700:02:14,960 --> 00:02:18,739life for our communities including those4800:02:17,510 --> 00:02:22,569with whom we share4900:02:18,739 --> 00:02:25,670in common thus design-thinking5000:02:22,569 --> 00:02:27,950intentionally adds a step in between the5100:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,470articulation of the problem and the5200:02:27,950 --> 00:02:33,530declaration of the solution that forces5300:02:30,470 --> 00:02:36,650us as public entrepreneurs to pause at5400:02:33,530 --> 00:02:39,459least to empathize and hopefully to talk5500:02:36,650 --> 00:02:42,530with the public we're trying to assist5600:02:39,459 --> 00:02:44,840such practices of discovery and evidence5700:02:42,530 --> 00:02:47,299gathering lead to a refinement of an5800:02:44,840 --> 00:02:49,489ill-defined problem and the development5900:02:47,299 --> 00:02:51,680of potential solutions informed by6000:02:49,489 --> 00:02:54,440learnings from real people in the field6100:02:51,680 --> 00:02:56,810especially in this day and age of6200:02:54,440 --> 00:02:59,019rampant inequality incorporating more6300:02:56,810 --> 00:03:02,030participatory methods of problem-solving6400:02:59,019 --> 00:03:04,159doing things with people rather than for6500:03:02,030 --> 00:03:06,319them is essential for boosting6600:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,220legitimacy as well as the effectiveness6700:03:06,319 --> 00:03:12,680of how we solve problems and social6800:03:10,220 --> 00:03:15,079psychology research also shows that when6900:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,329employees seek to benefit others and7000:03:15,079 --> 00:03:19,700consider the viewpoints of others and7100:03:17,329 --> 00:03:22,159their perspectives we are more likely to7200:03:19,700 --> 00:03:26,410be creative problem solvers who develop7300:03:22,159 --> 00:03:29,359ideas that are both novel and useful7400:03:26,410 --> 00:03:31,190Design Thinking refers to a process in7500:03:29,359 --> 00:03:32,840which the problem solver seeks to7600:03:31,190 --> 00:03:34,790understand the point of view of the7700:03:32,840 --> 00:03:38,510person for whom she is solving the7800:03:34,790 --> 00:03:40,879problem it also describes specific7900:03:38,510 --> 00:03:42,650methods and tools some of these involve8000:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,569strategies for empathizing with the8100:03:42,650 --> 00:03:46,849affected citizen while others are more8200:03:44,569 --> 00:03:49,099active include interviewing and talking8300:03:46,849 --> 00:03:51,049to humans to obtain and validate8400:03:49,099 --> 00:03:55,699evidence about the real nature of the8500:03:51,049 --> 00:03:57,949problem to solve this kind of social8600:03:55,699 --> 00:04:00,349research with individuals represents a8700:03:57,949 --> 00:04:02,180major complement to cost-benefit8800:04:00,349 --> 00:04:05,780approaches that seek to evaluate a8900:04:02,180 --> 00:04:07,400program at a macro level take another9000:04:05,780 --> 00:04:09,680example of using human centered design9100:04:07,400 --> 00:04:12,500and pro and practice take the work of9200:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,470the UK NHS the work they did to reduce9300:04:12,500 --> 00:04:18,109childhood obesity the NHS complemented9400:04:15,470 --> 00:04:20,359their data analysis of the problem by9500:04:18,109 --> 00:04:22,580talking to local communities to discuss9600:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,800the problem and then to collaboratively9700:04:22,580 --> 00:04:27,469design ideas that could reduce obesity9800:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,849they conducted rapid pilots of these9900:04:27,469 --> 00:04:30,620ideas with real people10000:04:28,849 --> 00:04:31,950and helped to develop initiatives into10100:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,260socially and10200:04:31,950 --> 00:04:36,690financially sustainable programs using10300:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,840facilitation and moderation of citizen10400:04:36,690 --> 00:04:42,120engagement so how do you put human10500:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,070Center design into practice how do we10600:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,870use it to test our assumptions about the10700:04:44,070 --> 00:04:49,320definition of our problem in the real10800:04:45,870 --> 00:04:50,910world and with real people there are10900:04:49,320 --> 00:04:53,250many practical strategies for11000:04:50,910 --> 00:04:55,470ethnographic research many of them call11100:04:53,250 --> 00:04:57,990for the designer to empathize with the11200:04:55,470 --> 00:05:01,110subject by putting oneself in someone11300:04:57,990 --> 00:05:03,810else's shoes many designers create11400:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,120personas are fictional archetypes of the11500:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,070people who will be affected others call11600:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,750for observing human behavior the way an11700:05:08,070 --> 00:05:12,360anthropologist studies people in their11800:05:09,750 --> 00:05:14,250own environments since we are here11900:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,780focused on active strategies and12000:05:14,250 --> 00:05:18,330engagement that helped to build the12100:05:15,780 --> 00:05:20,550legitimacy as well as the effectiveness12200:05:18,330 --> 00:05:22,800of problem-solving we focus on those12300:05:20,550 --> 00:05:25,590methods that actually involve talking to12400:05:22,800 --> 00:05:28,710humans both online and off observing12500:05:25,590 --> 00:05:30,840people while often imperative by itself12600:05:28,710 --> 00:05:33,120misses out on the wisdom and insight12700:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,040that people can share talking about12800:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,230fictional personas and archetypes can12900:05:35,040 --> 00:05:39,360result in missing important categories13000:05:37,230 --> 00:05:42,030of relevant people to consult such as13100:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,280university excerpt experts or anchored13200:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,080businesses or philanthropies or local13300:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,820government agencies who have important13400:05:46,080 --> 00:05:50,760information to share as part of the13500:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,530process qualitative Social Research has13600:05:50,760 --> 00:05:54,720always involved speaking with people13700:05:52,530 --> 00:05:57,150usually in the form of an interview or a13800:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,130survey but the digital age creates13900:05:57,150 --> 00:06:01,530opportunities for talking to more people14000:05:59,130 --> 00:06:04,350more quickly and in new ways than ever14100:06:01,530 --> 00:06:08,790before let's work through four exercises14200:06:04,350 --> 00:06:11,340that show you how first exercise is to14300:06:08,790 --> 00:06:14,220develop a plan for our research first14400:06:11,340 --> 00:06:16,290let's develop a plan for of attack for14500:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,820our research don't worry about taking14600:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,920notes on any of this we provide a14700:06:17,820 --> 00:06:21,840worksheet with a template for developing14800:06:19,920 --> 00:06:24,750this plan that's available to you on the14900:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,420website okay first we've got to identify15000:06:24,750 --> 00:06:29,910our project goals what do you actually15100:06:27,420 --> 00:06:32,040want to know how can a snog rafi help15200:06:29,910 --> 00:06:33,930you to learn that what kinds of things15300:06:32,040 --> 00:06:37,440do you want to ask or observe to confirm15400:06:33,930 --> 00:06:39,270the problem and its root causes second15500:06:37,440 --> 00:06:41,280we actually need to think about what we15600:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,770might call research and sampling design15700:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,020who needs to be interviewed or observed15800:06:43,770 --> 00:06:46,420what different types of individuals need15900:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,160to put16000:06:46,420 --> 00:06:50,710anticipate to get a really well-rounded16100:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,870view remember that the goal of this16200:06:50,710 --> 00:06:54,580ethnographic research is not to predict16300:06:52,870 --> 00:06:56,830behavior so you do not need a16400:06:54,580 --> 00:06:59,740particularly large or even a random16500:06:56,830 --> 00:07:01,660sample ideally you will keep observing16600:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,650and interviewing until you are no longer16700:07:01,660 --> 00:07:07,510surprised by what you learn okay next we16800:07:05,650 --> 00:07:09,670have to think about how we're going to16900:07:07,510 --> 00:07:11,770interview and observe people what do we17000:07:09,670 --> 00:07:13,480actually want to ask people what do we17100:07:11,770 --> 00:07:15,640want to observe to learn about the17200:07:13,480 --> 00:07:18,100problem what do you want participants to17300:07:15,640 --> 00:07:19,870show you what activity do you want them17400:07:18,100 --> 00:07:21,820to undertake do you want to take17500:07:19,870 --> 00:07:24,280pictures what tools can you use to17600:07:21,820 --> 00:07:26,170gather this information write down a17700:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,120series of questions and activities that17800:07:26,170 --> 00:07:29,980are going to last about an hour not17900:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,200longer some of these might involve18000:07:29,980 --> 00:07:35,080direct questions and others might simply18100:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,610involve participant observation okay18200:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,950next we have to think about how we're18300:07:36,610 --> 00:07:41,080going to recruit participants if you're18400:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,970focusing on face to face recipients of a18500:07:41,080 --> 00:07:44,680government service you might go to the18600:07:42,970 --> 00:07:47,200office where they receive that service18700:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,240third parties such as interest groups18800:07:47,200 --> 00:07:51,670and industry associations who regularly18900:07:49,240 --> 00:07:54,190convene their members or have membership19000:07:51,670 --> 00:07:57,010lists that you might use are a great way19100:07:54,190 --> 00:07:58,390to help you find participants okay then19200:07:57,010 --> 00:08:00,490you actually have to conduct the19300:07:58,390 --> 00:08:03,070research how are you going to gain19400:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,990participants trust what will you ask the19500:08:03,070 --> 00:08:07,030participant to accomplish how will you19600:08:04,990 --> 00:08:09,160explain the purpose and obtain consent19700:08:07,030 --> 00:08:11,470from the participant coming up with19800:08:09,160 --> 00:08:13,270icebreakers ahead of time can be useful19900:08:11,470 --> 00:08:15,550along with a written description of the20000:08:13,270 --> 00:08:18,600research to share with participants to20100:08:15,550 --> 00:08:19,780inform them and to get their consent20200:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,180okay20300:08:19,780 --> 00:08:24,310collecting and documenting your research20400:08:22,180 --> 00:08:26,590is very important you will need to be20500:08:24,310 --> 00:08:28,090equipped to gather the data tools might20600:08:26,590 --> 00:08:30,550include the obvious choices of a20700:08:28,090 --> 00:08:32,680notebook or a laptop but also a digital20800:08:30,550 --> 00:08:35,200pen that automatically transcribes your20900:08:32,680 --> 00:08:37,570notes a digital camera and an audio21000:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,610recorder or a phone as well as assorted21100:08:37,570 --> 00:08:41,530programs from managing and later sorting21200:08:39,610 --> 00:08:45,160observations such as Google key or21300:08:41,530 --> 00:08:46,570Evernote okay then we have to finally21400:08:45,160 --> 00:08:49,210think about how we're going to draw21500:08:46,570 --> 00:08:51,430insights and do the analysis throughout21600:08:49,210 --> 00:08:55,270the process endeavor to summarize and21700:08:51,430 --> 00:08:57,000unify your observations developing21800:08:55,270 --> 00:08:59,700recommendations in the end21900:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,800is our ultimate goal your analysis is22000:08:59,700 --> 00:09:04,050not designed to answer the question what22100:09:01,800 --> 00:09:07,710happened but to answer the question so22200:09:04,050 --> 00:09:09,690what drawing these conclusions and using22300:09:07,710 --> 00:09:11,310them to rewrite your problem definition22400:09:09,690 --> 00:09:15,780is the ultimate goal of your research22500:09:11,310 --> 00:09:17,730plan okay exercise two next we need to22600:09:15,780 --> 00:09:19,650start by identifying what kinds of22700:09:17,730 --> 00:09:21,960people to talk with to gather evidence22800:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,840about the problem which communities22900:09:21,960 --> 00:09:26,910organizations or individuals have them23000:09:24,840 --> 00:09:29,340know how to define the problem statement23100:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,950with you let's talk about what some of23200:09:29,340 --> 00:09:33,990the options are obviously there are23300:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,300residents these are the inhabitants of23400:09:33,990 --> 00:09:38,160the neighborhoods who will be affected23500:09:35,300 --> 00:09:40,380by the problem and whose expertise is23600:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,450rooted in the experience of living in23700:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,490that community the experience of23800:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,400residents is particularly important for23900:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,380defining and prioritizing problems and24000:09:47,400 --> 00:09:51,600getting their buy-in can help to ensure24100:09:49,380 --> 00:09:54,000that solutions will have maximum impact24200:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,610later so consider what residents might24300:09:54,000 --> 00:09:58,590be affected those who are longer or24400:09:56,610 --> 00:10:00,300shorter term residents as well as those24500:09:58,590 --> 00:10:03,150who have differing economic classes24600:10:00,300 --> 00:10:06,120genders race ethnicity and sexuality24700:10:03,150 --> 00:10:08,550should all be considered okay then there24800:10:06,120 --> 00:10:10,410are domain experts tapping into domain24900:10:08,550 --> 00:10:12,360expert knowledge can accelerate the25000:10:10,410 --> 00:10:14,060ideation process and deepen our25100:10:12,360 --> 00:10:16,470understanding of the problem25200:10:14,060 --> 00:10:18,480sociologists anthropologists urban25300:10:16,470 --> 00:10:20,760planners and political scientists often25400:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,950have know-how about communities and25500:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,230their residents depending on the nature25600:10:22,950 --> 00:10:27,150of the problem technologists designers25700:10:25,230 --> 00:10:29,460and data scientists might be of greater25800:10:27,150 --> 00:10:31,350relevance and they're also subject25900:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,750specific experts depending on the26000:10:31,350 --> 00:10:35,760problem experts can be found in many26100:10:33,750 --> 00:10:39,650places and turning to local universities26200:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,530for help is one way to find them okay26300:10:39,650 --> 00:10:44,760another category is that of nonprofits26400:10:42,530 --> 00:10:47,190nongovernmental organizations and26500:10:44,760 --> 00:10:49,860not-for-profit businesses are a distinct26600:10:47,190 --> 00:10:51,870source of know-how some organizations26700:10:49,860 --> 00:10:54,420may already be working directly in the26800:10:51,870 --> 00:10:56,640problem area and consulting with people26900:10:54,420 --> 00:10:58,140excuse-me consulting with them might27000:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,510accelerate our understanding of the27100:10:58,140 --> 00:11:02,160problem they may also have direct27200:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,140relationships with the residents you27300:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,660want to reach out to and help you to27400:11:04,140 --> 00:11:08,340accelerate your outreach criteria by27500:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,290which you might segment your NGO27600:11:08,340 --> 00:11:11,720community27700:11:09,290 --> 00:11:13,759include economic nonprofits there are27800:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,860development organizations legal ones27900:11:13,759 --> 00:11:17,889their workforce training groups their28000:11:15,860 --> 00:11:20,209research NGOs like think tanks28100:11:17,889 --> 00:11:22,519environmental groups health groups human28200:11:20,209 --> 00:11:24,920rights groups their state and city level28300:11:22,519 --> 00:11:27,440NGOs charitable as well as faith-based28400:11:24,920 --> 00:11:30,110organizations there's a wide range of28500:11:27,440 --> 00:11:32,420expertise available in the NGO community28600:11:30,110 --> 00:11:35,240a separate category is that of28700:11:32,420 --> 00:11:37,370community-based organizations these are28800:11:35,240 --> 00:11:39,829also nonprofit organizations but they28900:11:37,370 --> 00:11:41,899work in specific communities and they29000:11:39,829 --> 00:11:44,300can offer a deep understanding of small29100:11:41,899 --> 00:11:46,459geographic areas and may have ties to29200:11:44,300 --> 00:11:47,899people that are difficult to access so29300:11:46,459 --> 00:11:50,600this is transient residence or29400:11:47,899 --> 00:11:52,959ex-offenders or undocumented immigrants29500:11:50,600 --> 00:11:54,139that may be important for your research29600:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,750okay29700:11:54,139 --> 00:11:58,639then there's business and industry many29800:11:56,750 --> 00:12:00,440policies and services affect the29900:11:58,639 --> 00:12:02,990businesses that create jobs and drive30000:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,790economic growth in the community the30100:12:02,990 --> 00:12:06,800relevant audience could be owners or30200:12:04,790 --> 00:12:09,440managers or employees depending on the30300:12:06,800 --> 00:12:11,060issue also businesses employ people with30400:12:09,440 --> 00:12:13,579domain knowledge that may be of great30500:12:11,060 --> 00:12:15,680use to you enlighten companies will30600:12:13,579 --> 00:12:17,060share an interest in the well-being of30700:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,190the communities in which they are30800:12:17,060 --> 00:12:21,560located and to which they sell and30900:12:19,190 --> 00:12:24,860involving them might help to bring more31000:12:21,560 --> 00:12:26,209resources to bear on a problem okay31100:12:24,860 --> 00:12:28,850then there are the groups that we might31200:12:26,209 --> 00:12:30,800call anchor institutions these are31300:12:28,850 --> 00:12:32,990institutions or businesses that play31400:12:30,800 --> 00:12:35,149such an outsized role in the affected31500:12:32,990 --> 00:12:37,430communities economy that they deserve31600:12:35,149 --> 00:12:40,100their own category policies that affect31700:12:37,430 --> 00:12:42,069them will in turn impact other residents31800:12:40,100 --> 00:12:44,720and other businesses who service them31900:12:42,069 --> 00:12:47,209examples of anchor institutions are the32000:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,880major businesses in a company town or32100:12:47,209 --> 00:12:52,910the or a university in a campus town or32200:12:49,880 --> 00:12:56,209libraries or museums or churches or key32300:12:52,910 --> 00:12:57,829nonprofits like a hospital finally there32400:12:56,209 --> 00:13:00,800are government entities and their32500:12:57,829 --> 00:13:02,839employees public officials often have32600:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,660knowledge of constraints that help to32700:13:02,839 --> 00:13:07,550define feasible and impactful projects32800:13:05,660 --> 00:13:10,399as well as an understanding of how to32900:13:07,550 --> 00:13:12,439translate solutions into policy you33000:13:10,399 --> 00:13:14,540should consider how public officials at33100:13:12,439 --> 00:13:16,519each level of government might help you33200:13:14,540 --> 00:13:18,889this includes both elected and appointed33300:13:16,519 --> 00:13:20,350officials and their staff as well as33400:13:18,889 --> 00:13:23,090civil servants in the executive33500:13:20,350 --> 00:13:24,890legislative or judicial organization33600:13:23,090 --> 00:13:26,570as well as public officials from other33700:13:24,890 --> 00:13:27,290places who have worked on the same33800:13:26,570 --> 00:13:29,690problem33900:13:27,290 --> 00:13:32,180oh one more category that I almost34000:13:29,690 --> 00:13:33,980forgot and that is philanthropy these34100:13:32,180 --> 00:13:35,930are foundations and charities that have34200:13:33,980 --> 00:13:36,890an interest in funding responses to the34300:13:35,930 --> 00:13:39,740problem at issue34400:13:36,890 --> 00:13:41,810they often possess deep expertise about34500:13:39,740 --> 00:13:44,480the project and have a good overview of34600:13:41,810 --> 00:13:46,400who is doing what in the same space they34700:13:44,480 --> 00:13:48,920can also provide additional resources to34800:13:46,400 --> 00:13:51,890fund solutions and they may be willing34900:13:48,920 --> 00:13:53,540to be more experimental this group may35000:13:51,890 --> 00:13:55,730include people such as religious leaders35100:13:53,540 --> 00:13:58,810and corporate social responsibility35200:13:55,730 --> 00:14:02,810officers as well from the private sector35300:13:58,810 --> 00:14:04,190okay using this guide brainstorm who35400:14:02,810 --> 00:14:06,500needs to be asked35500:14:04,190 --> 00:14:08,540make sure to include diverse kinds of35600:14:06,500 --> 00:14:11,000people focusing in particular on those35700:14:08,540 --> 00:14:13,090least likely to have been heard make35800:14:11,000 --> 00:14:15,740sure that you're hearing all viewpoints35900:14:13,090 --> 00:14:18,440once we've identified who we're going to36000:14:15,740 --> 00:14:20,660talk to then we need to think about why36100:14:18,440 --> 00:14:22,940we're going to engage them for this36200:14:20,660 --> 00:14:26,750exercise let's start with specific36300:14:22,940 --> 00:14:28,490strategies for interviewing people when36400:14:26,750 --> 00:14:30,560conducting interviews we first want to36500:14:28,490 --> 00:14:32,480prepare our list of questions and test36600:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,090these on a few people before adopting36700:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,710our interview guide widely this will36800:14:35,090 --> 00:14:38,150help us to understand what may not be36900:14:36,710 --> 00:14:42,140clear to people and which questions37000:14:38,150 --> 00:14:44,390elicit the most useful responses use a37100:14:42,140 --> 00:14:46,700combination of short and long answer37200:14:44,390 --> 00:14:48,800formats and follow yes and no questions37300:14:46,700 --> 00:14:51,110with questions about why people have37400:14:48,800 --> 00:14:53,600that view asking them for an example or37500:14:51,110 --> 00:14:55,790a story to illustrate we want to be sure37600:14:53,600 --> 00:14:57,110to tell people how we plan to use the37700:14:55,790 --> 00:14:59,540information that they share with us37800:14:57,110 --> 00:15:01,460people are more likely to give of their37900:14:59,540 --> 00:15:03,860time if they know their input will be38000:15:01,460 --> 00:15:07,339relevant and have an impact on decision38100:15:03,860 --> 00:15:09,050making one further practical strategy to38200:15:07,339 --> 00:15:11,030compliment interviewing is what's called38300:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,160service blueprinting also known as38400:15:11,030 --> 00:15:14,660journey mapping service blueprinting38500:15:13,160 --> 00:15:17,180involves developing a step-by-step38600:15:14,660 --> 00:15:19,490rundown of a process in the public38700:15:17,180 --> 00:15:21,710sector context this refers specifically38800:15:19,490 --> 00:15:23,780to documenting how a government service38900:15:21,710 --> 00:15:25,850is delivered or how a policy works in39000:15:23,780 --> 00:15:27,980practice well there's no rigid39100:15:25,850 --> 00:15:29,300definition jur of journey mapping it's39200:15:27,980 --> 00:15:31,400frequently used to capture the39300:15:29,300 --> 00:15:33,620experience from the individual citizen39400:15:31,400 --> 00:15:35,360perspective where service blueprinting39500:15:33,620 --> 00:15:36,740documents the process from the39600:15:35,360 --> 00:15:39,140institutional perspective39700:15:36,740 --> 00:15:41,300this method especially when done in39800:15:39,140 --> 00:15:43,820collaboration with affected citizens and39900:15:41,300 --> 00:15:46,730civil servants can help with laying bare40000:15:43,820 --> 00:15:49,010just how complex and uncomfortable the40100:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,010customer experience is and how much it40200:15:49,010 --> 00:15:53,450deviates from our expectations40300:15:51,010 --> 00:15:55,430five years ago my co-author and I40400:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,860documented the pathway of a non profit40500:15:55,430 --> 00:16:00,920tax return from filing through40600:15:57,860 --> 00:16:03,200processing by the IRS it was only in40700:16:00,920 --> 00:16:05,860doing so that we discovered that the IRS40800:16:03,200 --> 00:16:08,720was taking electronically filed returns40900:16:05,860 --> 00:16:11,300printing them out and scanning them back41000:16:08,720 --> 00:16:14,270in thereby rendering a useful digital41100:16:11,300 --> 00:16:17,060file into a useless image revealing this41200:16:14,270 --> 00:16:19,310almost unbelievable inefficiency played41300:16:17,060 --> 00:16:22,490a big part in an eventual decision by41400:16:19,310 --> 00:16:25,340the IRS to digitize all non profit tax41500:16:22,490 --> 00:16:29,000returns and in a law from Congress41600:16:25,340 --> 00:16:31,190mandating electronic filing okay to41700:16:29,000 --> 00:16:33,770create a process map of the service41800:16:31,190 --> 00:16:36,140experience use interviews and surveys of41900:16:33,770 --> 00:16:39,260individuals and groups to record42000:16:36,140 --> 00:16:40,670first of all citizen actions the steps42100:16:39,260 --> 00:16:44,060that must be taken in chronological42200:16:40,670 --> 00:16:46,100order to receive the service but then we42300:16:44,060 --> 00:16:47,840have to document public servant actions42400:16:46,100 --> 00:16:49,940the steps that must be taken in42500:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,570chronological order to deliver the42600:16:49,940 --> 00:16:56,180service make sure to record face-to-face42700:16:53,570 --> 00:16:59,150contact note any live interactions that42800:16:56,180 --> 00:17:01,400are part of the process but we also want42900:16:59,150 --> 00:17:03,560to record virtual contact don't any43000:17:01,400 --> 00:17:06,410phone calls or web-based interactions43100:17:03,560 --> 00:17:08,870that need to take place finally we want43200:17:06,410 --> 00:17:11,000to document support processes additional43300:17:08,870 --> 00:17:13,100interactions including interactions with43400:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,200anyone who is not a direct contact43500:17:13,100 --> 00:17:18,350employee but is necessary for the43600:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,420service to be provided finally we want43700:17:18,350 --> 00:17:22,400to document the conditions describe the43800:17:20,420 --> 00:17:24,260conditions under which the service is43900:17:22,400 --> 00:17:26,240provided this might be the physical44000:17:24,260 --> 00:17:29,480condition of the office for example or a44100:17:26,240 --> 00:17:31,250description of a website use this map or44200:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,740blueprint to find the points of failure44300:17:31,250 --> 00:17:36,680and engage in pre-emptive44400:17:32,740 --> 00:17:38,960problem-solving okay want to leverage44500:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,970new technology to ask more people what44600:17:38,960 --> 00:17:43,790they think the problems are or to help44700:17:40,970 --> 00:17:47,930identify root causes consider using a44800:17:43,790 --> 00:17:50,090wiki survey designed by professor of44900:17:47,930 --> 00:17:52,549sociology from Princeton Matt Sal45000:17:50,090 --> 00:17:54,830adding the free all our ideas wiki45100:17:52,549 --> 00:17:56,870survey tool allows anyone to create a45200:17:54,830 --> 00:17:59,630collaborative survey at no cost to them45300:17:56,870 --> 00:18:01,880and identify which problems feel are45400:17:59,630 --> 00:18:04,010most salient to end to suggest45500:18:01,880 --> 00:18:06,679alternative problems and their root45600:18:04,010 --> 00:18:08,840causes wiki surveys combine the45700:18:06,679 --> 00:18:11,360advantages of closed and open-ended45800:18:08,840 --> 00:18:13,940questions the tool was originally called45900:18:11,360 --> 00:18:15,470which one do you want more because it46000:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,630presents the viewer with a choice46100:18:15,470 --> 00:18:21,020between two responses46200:18:17,630 --> 00:18:23,260respondents receive exactly two randomly46300:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,640generated options from which to choose46400:18:23,260 --> 00:18:27,919users can respond to as many questions46500:18:25,640 --> 00:18:31,370as they would like or stop at any time46600:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,340they can also select view results to see46700:18:31,370 --> 00:18:35,899how other participants are voting with46800:18:33,340 --> 00:18:38,870scores for each question and data46900:18:35,899 --> 00:18:41,210visualization participants can submit47000:18:38,870 --> 00:18:42,770their own contributions to such as an47100:18:41,210 --> 00:18:44,929additional root cause or a problem47200:18:42,770 --> 00:18:46,700statement using a hundred and forty47300:18:44,929 --> 00:18:49,279characters or less and submit as many47400:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,169ideas as they choose when an idea is47500:18:49,279 --> 00:18:53,029submitted it is reviewed by the creator47600:18:51,169 --> 00:18:55,820of the survey to monitor for47700:18:53,029 --> 00:18:57,559appropriateness and if it's approved the47800:18:55,820 --> 00:18:59,270idea will start appearing as an answer47900:18:57,559 --> 00:19:02,179choice under the corresponding question48000:18:59,270 --> 00:19:04,760as more people complete the to response48100:19:02,179 --> 00:19:07,460surveys the tool evaluates compares48200:19:04,760 --> 00:19:09,470ideas and allows new ideas to bubble up48300:19:07,460 --> 00:19:12,260so the results accurately reflect48400:19:09,470 --> 00:19:14,929collective wisdom all our ideas has been48500:19:12,260 --> 00:19:16,159used for over 14,000 wiki survey48600:19:14,929 --> 00:19:19,220mechanisms to date48700:19:16,159 --> 00:19:21,049of course all our ideas is far from the48800:19:19,220 --> 00:19:23,299only choice of tool there are numerous48900:19:21,049 --> 00:19:24,919commercial options also available for49000:19:23,299 --> 00:19:27,799getting input from people about the49100:19:24,919 --> 00:19:31,460problem such as the AI based tool remesh49200:19:27,799 --> 00:19:34,700or the open source AI tool polis or you49300:19:31,460 --> 00:19:37,370can just create your own survey by49400:19:34,700 --> 00:19:39,230trying some or all of the four methods49500:19:37,370 --> 00:19:41,450we've just run through you will have49600:19:39,230 --> 00:19:44,390tested your understanding of the problem49700:19:41,450 --> 00:19:46,399with people in a real-world context that49800:19:44,390 --> 00:19:49,070is a prerequisite for developing49900:19:46,399 --> 00:19:51,200meaningful solutions it's important to50000:19:49,070 --> 00:19:53,120point out however that despite the rapid50100:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,580rise in popularity of human centered50200:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,710approaches these design strategies50300:19:55,580 --> 00:20:00,530should be complemented by other forms of50400:19:57,710 --> 00:20:02,659evidence-based gathering especially the50500:20:00,530 --> 00:20:03,380use of data-driven analysis to gain50600:20:02,659 --> 00:20:06,500insight50700:20:03,380 --> 00:20:10,360to a situation that is the subject of50800:20:06,500 --> 00:20:10,360the next module thank you
